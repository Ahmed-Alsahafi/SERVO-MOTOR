in this subtask it was asked to design a circuit that controls the rotation of a 5 servo motors using a potentiometer.

please click on this link to view the screanshoot of the circuit  { https://prnt.sc/17204k8 } 








and here is the arduino code used:

#include <Servo.h>
int x=0;
Servo ser;
void setup() 
{
  ser.attach(12);
}
void loop()
{
  x=analogRead(A1);
  x=map(x,0,1023,10,170);
  ser.write(x);
}

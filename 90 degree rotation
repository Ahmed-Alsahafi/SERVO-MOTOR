in this subtask it was asked to design a circuit that rotates 5 servo motors by a 90 degrees.

pleases click on this link to view the circuit used in the design https://prnt.sc/1720yr2

and here is the arduieno code:

#include <Servo.h>
int x=0;
Servo ser;
void setup() 
{
  ser.attach(12);
}
void loop()
{
  x=90;
  ser.write(x);
}
